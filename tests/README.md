![Alt text](<API_Stress_Test/img/locust_start_page.png>)

-- you'll get above page

-- there you can fill in the details you want; amount of users, the rate at which you want the endpoints to get hit in seconds, then the host, which is `https://api2.painelconstru.com.br`, then you can start swarming.

-- the rest should be easy and straightforward from there.
