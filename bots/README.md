If you tried to run the `pa_api_get_items.py` file and it refused to budge..:

-- try to follow the instructions 1 and 2 in the image below

-- at 2, run `python3 setup.py install` in the Terminal instead, if you're on Windows (make sure you're using python3 version, verify by typing `python --version` or `py -0p`)

-- after successful installation, run the file again, which should work now, flawlessly.
